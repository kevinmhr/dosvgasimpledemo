/*
 *    Example program for the Allegro library, by Shawn Hargreaves.
 *
 *    This program demonstrates how to load and display a bitmap
 *    file.  You have to use this example from the command line to
 *    specify as first parameter a graphic file in one of Allegro's
 *    supported formats.  If the file is loaded successfully,
 *    it will be displayed until you press a key.
